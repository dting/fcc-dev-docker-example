# Sync folders configuration
synced_folders:
    # nfs: better performance on Mac, recommended.
    # smb: better performance on Windows. Requires Vagrant to be run with admin privileges.
    # smb2: experimental, does not require running vagrant as admin.
    # rsync: the best performance, cross-platform platform, one-way only. Run `vagrant rsync-auto` to start auto sync.
    #   When using rsync sync type the "folders" list below is mandatory.
    # vboxfs (or leave empty): best compatibility and ease of setup, but poor performance.
    type: 'nfs'
    # smb_user, smb_password - The username and password used for authentication to mount the SMB mount.
    # This is usually your Windows username and password, unless you created a dedicated user for vagrant.
    # If using the 'smb2' type above the user and share will be configured automatically.
    smb_username: 'vagrant'
    smb_password: 'vagrant'
    # List of folders to sync with rsync. These should be subfolder names within the <Projects> folder (e.g. "drupal7")
    # Uncomment and add folders per the example below as neccessary.
    # Note: you'll have to run `vagrant rsync-auto` in the background to keep the files in sync as you make changes
    folders:
      #- "projectA"  # rsync projectA folder
      #- "projectB"  # rsync projectB folder
      #- ""  # rsync the whole <Projects> folder. WARNING: don't do this if your <Projects> folder is big.

# VirtualBox VM settings
v.gui: false  # Set to true for debugging. Will unhide VM's primary console screen.
v.memory: 2048  # Memory settings.
v.cpus: 1  # CPU settings. VirtualBox works much better with a single CPU.

# Network settings
# The default box private network IP is 192.168.10.10
# Uncomment lines below to map additional IP addresses for use with multiple projects.
# Project specific `<IP>:<port>` mapping for containers is done in via docker-compose in `docker-compose.yml`
hosts:
    #- ip: 192.168.10.11
    #- ip: 192.168.10.12
    #- ip: 192.168.10.13

# Automatically start containers if docker-compose.yml is present in the current directory (default: false).
compose_autostart: false

# vhost-proxy
# Use a reverse proxy to map host name to containers.
# This is an alternative to using dedicated IP addresses in the 'hosts' section above.
# Containers must define a "VIRTUAL_HOST" environment variable to be recognized and routed by the vhost-proxy.
